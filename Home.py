        This application connects to the AACT (Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov) database,
        which provides comprehensive data on clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.
        
        **Key Features:**
        - **Metropolitan Area Analysis**: Consolidates cities within the Greater Toronto Area and Metro Vancouver
        - **Population-Normalized Metrics**: Visualizes trial density per 100,000 residents
        - **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses Anthropic's Claude to identify rare disease trials
        - **Advanced Data Visualization**: Interactive charts, maps, and network diagrams
        
        **Technologies:**
        - Streamlit for the web interface
        - Plotly for interactive visualizations
        - NetworkX for condition network analysis
        - Anthropic's Claude AI for rare disease classification

    ### How to Use This Application
    
    1. Navigate to any of the main modules using the buttons above
    2. Apply filters to focus on specific trial subsets
    3. Explore the various visualization tabs to gain insights
    4. View detailed information about specific trials of interest
    5. For rare disease research, use the classifier to identify relevant trials
    
    **Data Privacy Note**: This application processes clinical trial data locally and only uses the Anthropic API
    for rare disease classification when explicitly requested.
    
    **Source Code**: Find more information in the project README and documentation.
