    ### How to Use This Application
    
    1. Navigate to any of the main modules using the buttons above
    2. Apply filters to focus on specific trial subsets
    3. Explore the various visualization tabs to gain insights
    4. View detailed information about specific trials of interest
    5. For rare disease research, use the classifier to identify relevant trials
    
    **Data Privacy Note**: This application processes clinical trial data locally and only uses the Anthropic API
    for rare disease classification when explicitly requested.
